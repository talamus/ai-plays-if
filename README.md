# AI plays Interactive Fiction

Load a Large Language Model and make it play classical Infocom Interactive Fiction. Games not included.

The Interactive Fiction engine used is [MojoZork](https://github.com/icculus/mojozork).

(This is just a fun test project for learning LLM prompting and handling.)
