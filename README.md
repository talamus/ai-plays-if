# AI plays Interactive Fiction

Load a Large Language Model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) and make it play a classical Infocom text adventure game (a.k.a interactive fiction).

* The Z-Machine engine used is [MojoZork](https://github.com/icculus/mojozork).
* For games see [The Historical Source](https://github.com/historicalsource/).

(This is just a fun test project for learning about LLM prompting and handling stuff...)
